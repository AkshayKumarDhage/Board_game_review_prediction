Reviews can make or break a product; as a result, many companies take drastic measures to ensure that their product receives good reviews. When it comes to board games, reviews and word-of-mouth are everything. In this project, we will be using a linear regression model to predict the average review a board game will receive based on characteristics such as minimum and maximum number of players, playing time, complexity, etc.

we will deploy a simple linear regression model to predict the average review of each board game. We will use the mean squared error as a performance metric. Furthermore, we will compare and contrast these results with the performance of an ensemble method.
